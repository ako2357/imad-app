    <hr>
    <p>I had taught mathematics in several Govt colleges in Orissa for about 40 years. As 
			 I taught from plus two level and then engineering  upto post graduate level in these colleges, my interst
			 grew in mentoring the students sitting at the back of the classes. Towards the last
			 stage , I developed a unque style of teaching mathematics in a class room. 
    </p>
		<p>If you would enter my class you would certainly not like the proceedings. After I introduce a topic I encourage the students 
       to participate in the discussion.It would be somewhat a free for all class. Sometimes a chaotic one. I would not mind if 
       some stood or sat or talked in groups or with the neighbours as long as they remained focussed on the topic.I keep a close eye
       on the entire class and intervene when I wanted to make a point of my own. When satisfied I would proceed to the next topic .
       Finally I would ask them to think of a problem or I would write a problem on the board and ask them to think how to crack it.
       I  made sure that learning happened and the student made progress. All kinds of threats were put aside the back benchers took 
       active part and began to ask questions.
     </p>
	 <p> I now believe learning certainly needs a conducive environment. A student is in  need of a relaxed state of the mind so that 
			 its engagement with the topic under discussion will have a free flow. In such a state he is more likely to come out with
			 his ideas and questions. There will be little hindrance in his participation.
