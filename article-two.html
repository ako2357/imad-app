    <h4 style="font-family:Sans-serif"><i>  The cat is not coming anymore.<br>
          Some days ago my son drove it away.</i>
    </h4>
      <h4>To my delight it mewed in yesterday. I could soon see the difference. Its walk has changed.
          It is rather circumspect. When our eyes met, it halted, with its front left leg raised, hesitating.
          Unsure whether to put it down or not. The glance has also changed. It is in despair!
          There is no spontaneous urge to march into the kitchen and mew for its cup of milk.
          After a while it turned back and disappeared ignoring my friendly utterances.
          How quickly it has learnt the art of cold indifference?<br>
          Our relationship with the cat had its ups and downs. In the beginning we would instinctively drive
          it away when it ventured in. My twenty six year old son would wait for it to come closer and then
          run after it with childish playfulness. He would not stop until it was out of sight altogether.
          Later, we would mostly look the other way when it came for a visit. Our interest in the cat took a
          turn when Pandababu’s wife told that it would be very auspicious if a cat delivered its babies in ones house. “Let it come”, I told my husband who has no particular interest in these kind of convictions. Often, when we go out riding our bike or our car, he never slows down or stops for a while when a cat crosses the road ahead. It is only when I would shout, “Stop, stop”, he would. He looks baffled as to how a cat can cause any harm if it crosses our path. I have to ignore his mutterings every time. These things are too complicated to explain. Thankfully he stops every time.<br>
          A few days ago on a Sunday the cat appeared from nowhere. It was 7am in the morning. I made some
          welcome gestures. It sauntered behind. I entered the kitchen and placed a full bowl of milk on the floor.
          It was impressed! Next day it came again at the same time. This time it got a plate full of cheese.
          For some days it continued . Alternatively it would be milk, curd or cheese. (We are vegetarians.)
          Soon our earlier equation of friendliness got restored .We did not mind. On occasions, when the morning treat failed to show up it would come near me and rub its body against my legs. It was her gentle request for breakfast. But gradually it became bold. Too much bold!
          <br>Then one day something happened .I was taking my morning cup of milk and biscuits while sitting on the sofa. I had not seen it come. My mind was busy figuring out some matter of import. It tried to draw my attention .It did not work. Suddenly it raised its legs and scratched my thighs vigorously. Its nails did hurt. Instinctively a full-throated shout came out of my mouth.  My milk spilled over. The biscuits flew out of my hand on to some remote corner. From nowhere my husband appeared .He had a stick in his hand. (Wherefrom did he get it?)  Apparently the cat got a sound beating. But,”Oh. My God. It was carrying!!!”, I murmured. A touch of sadness and anguish gave way to helplessness. “How could you be so ruthless?”,I shouted at my husband.
          <br>Now a days, when I come across a cat in the streets , I instinctively look at it with a shade of tenderness that I never felt before.
