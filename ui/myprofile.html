					<h2>My past</h2>
				</header>
			<p> I had taught mathematics in several Govt colleges in Orissa. As 
			I taught from plus two level upto post graduate level in these colleges, my interst
			grew in mentoring the students sitting at the back of the classes. Towards the last
			stage , I developed a unque style of teaching mathematics in a class room. </p>
			<p>If you would enter my class you would certainly not like the proceedings. It would be somewhat a free for all class. A chaotic
			one.I would not mind if they stood or sat or talked in groups or with the neighbours. I wanted learning to happen in a pleasurable ambience. All kinds of threats were put aside.<p>
			<p>I now believe learning certainly needs a conducive environment. A student is in  need of a relaxed state of the mind so that 
			its engagement with the topic under discussion will have a free flow. In such a state he is more likely to come out with
			his ideas and questions. There will be little hindrance in his participation. </p>
			<p>As I progressed in my experiments I realised the following points.
			<ul>
				<li>Struggle</li>
				<p>Struggle is an extremely important component of learning. It is an extremely delicate state of the mind. 
				When in struggle a chain of thoughts emanate to link up with previous ideas already stored.
				If association somehow gets established struggle becomes less tortuous. Otherwise the chain gets broken 
				and the mind wavers away.Each student needs encouragement to continue the struggle. If the struggle continues 
				,soon he is bound to feel less intimidated .The urge to continue will prevail. Level of relaxation will increase .
				At this point, even if he disengages, his diffuse mode of learning will set in . At other times he will continue to engage
				his mind in the topic. Fortunately if he succeeds, struggle will cease to overwhelm him and enjoyment will take
				over.The degree of engagement with the struggle determines his progress because struggle is itself the channel 
				within which learning happens.</p>
				<li>Mistakes</li>
				<p>Students loathe mistakes. Once done they fall apart . Often, it becomes a break point for the continuity 
				of the struggle. Mind moves away to other pleasurable occupations.But without mistakes nothing happens .
				A human is designed to make mistakes and learn from the mistakes. Mistakes are just milestones in the progress 
				of learning. More mistakes implies learning is going deep. The brain travels from one mistake to another and 
				forms stronger and stronger association with the topic under its focus.</p>
				<li> Belief</p>
				<p>When the struggle gets tougher and tougher, the topic is extremely likely to fly away from his consciousness.
				At this point, if the belief that he can crack it gets pronounced, then the topic will continue to remain in
				touch. So belief plays a major role in bridge.</p>
