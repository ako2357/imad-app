    <h1>As I progressed in my experiments I realised the following points.</h1>
    <ul>
        <li>Struggle</li>
				       <p>Struggle is an extremely important component of learning. It is an extremely delicate state of the mind. 
				          When in struggle a chain of thoughts emanate to link up with previous ideas already stored.
				          If association somehow gets established struggle becomes less tortuous. Otherwise the chain gets broken 
				          and the mind wavers away.Each student needs encouragement to continue the struggle. If the struggle continues 
				          ,soon he is bound to feel less intimidated .The urge to continue will prevail. Level of relaxation will increase .
				          At this point, even if he disengages, his diffuse mode of learning will set in . At other times he will continue
                  to engage his mind in the topic. Fortunately if he succeeds, struggle will cease to overwhelm him and enjoyment 
                  will take over.The degree of engagement with the struggle determines his progress because struggle is itself the channel 
				          within which learning happens.
                        </p>
		<li>Mistakes</li>
				        <p>Students loathe mistakes. Once done they fall apart . Often, it becomes a break point for the continuity 
                        of the struggle. Mind moves away to other pleasurable occupations.But without mistakes nothing happens .
                        A human is designed to make mistakes and learn from the mistakes. Mistakes are just milestones in the progress 
                        of learning. More mistakes implies learning is going deep. The brain travels from one mistake to another and 
                        forms stronger and stronger association with the topic under its focus.
                        </p>
		<li> Belief</li>
                        <p>When the struggle gets tougher and tougher, the topic is extremely likely to fly away from his consciousness.
                        At this point, if the belief that he can crack it gets pronounced, then the topic will continue to remain in
                        touch. So belief plays a major role in bridge.
                        </p>
